A very basic implementation of various machine-learning aglorithms.

Currently available:
- (Deep) neural networks with multiple activation functions, loss functions, and training algorithms, for supervised learning.
- Simulation based training of neural network based controllers with a genetic algorithm.
- Table based (Q) reinforcement learning, with very basic automatic and incremental discretization of the observation space.

## Install ##

```
pip install path-to-simple-nn.whl
```

or

```
python setup.py install
```

It is recommended to run the above commands in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) in order to prevent installed dependencies from interfering with system packages.
